Checkout the documentation and questions for understanding and results
1. Simulated computationally the shape of the unit ball centered at origin with different extreme values of p norm of a vector - 0 < p < infinity and p<1.

2. Randomly prepared normally distributed data that is linearly seperable and implemented a perceptron to classify the data

3. Simulated probabilites for the monty-hall problem

4. Bulit a pseudo-random number generator and performed statistical analysis using the csv file.
